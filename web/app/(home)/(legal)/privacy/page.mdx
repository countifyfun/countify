This Privacy Policy explains how we at Countify Labs collect, use, store, and share your information. Use of Countify and it's services is considered an agreement to the terms in this Policy.

## What data does Countify store?

- Server IDs
- Channel IDs
- Message IDs

## Why does Countify need this data, and how is it used?

1. Server IDs are stored to save settings specifically setup by the server owner.

2. Channel IDs are stored to be able to recognize whether a message is coming from a channel that the server owner has setup to be a counting channel.

3. Message IDs are stored to keep track of what the last message was. This is especially used for the [no deletion feature](/docs/settings/no-deletion) in Countify.

## Does Countify share our data with any 3rd parties?

No, we don't share data with any 3rd parties. So you'll be rest assured your data won't appear on the dark web!

## How can users contact the bot owner?

Users can join our [support server](/discord), or email us at [hey@countify.fun](mailto:hey@countify.fun).
